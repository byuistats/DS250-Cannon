Here are a few essential items.
Your goal is to demonstrate your data science coding abilities. Get through as many items with a rough implementation as possible. Get your code to match our outputs as close as possible, but don&amp;rsquo;t stress over minute details. Keep most of the code you type. If you end up not using specific parts, comment them out and include them at the bottom.</description></item></channel></rss>
