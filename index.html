Indexing, .loc[] and .iloc[] I may not be experienced enough to understand why I should teach you these. I think they all add complexity to what we are learning in the course and we have elected to avoid it. We will use reset_index() a lot. I think MultiIndex features create complication. I have also elected to use .filter() instead of .loc[] because I like it.\nVirtual Environments Virtual Environments appear to be an important tool as you continue to use Python.

You should work through it on your own. This serves as an assessment of your understanding of the assigned readings.\nBefore you start Make sure you have installed VS-code, pandas, and altair on your computer. You can install these package by typing this line in the terminal.\npip install pandas altair\nOR if you have more than one version of python\npip3.9 install pandas altair\npip3.9 indicates the version of python you are installing the packages to.\nPart 1 Get familiar with your tools Programming involves a lot of research. Unlike subjects like Mathematics or History, we are not required to remember every single function and its usage. It is natural for experienced programmers to look for answers on the internet, books, even from other people\u0026rsquo;s code. Programming will be extremely frustrating if we are not allowed to do web searches, so please get familiar with the tools you have and use them often.\nOffical Documentation This should be your first resort for understanding any code\/function. Scanning the documentation of a function will allow you to get an overview of its usage.\nHere is a link to the documentation of the assign() function:\n(https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/docs\/reference\/api\/pandas.DataFrame.assign.html)\nExample of assign() (as shown in the documentation)\nimport pandas as pd df1 = pd.DataFrame({\u0026#39;temp_c\u0026#39;: [17.0, 25.0]}, index=[\u0026#39;Portland\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Berkeley\u0026#39;]) df2 = df1.assign(temp_f=df1.temp_c * 9 \/ 5 \u002b 32) Exercise 1: After reading the documentation for assign(), write a short paragraph to explain assign() as if you were talking to someone with zero programming experience (use the example above to help you explain assign()).\n What is the difference between df1 and df2? How was df2 derived from df1?)  Online textbook It pains us to see students would rather be stuck at problems for hours yet they refuse to use the textbook. This is another very useful resource since this is designed for this class. link to the textbook: (https:\/\/byuidatascience.github.io\/python4ds\/)\nExercise 2: Locate the section where the textbook talks about query() and answer these questions.\n What function in R\u0026rsquo;s dplyr is equivalent or comparable to query() in pandas (You should include the section number in your answer)? What is the easiest mistake for python beginner to make that was shown in the text about query() (You should include the section number in your answer)?  The internet Google is a programmer\u0026rsquo;s friend. Get used to googling thing, in fact, you want to be an expert in googling\n Question that cannot be answered by the textbook and documentation? Google it. A function you have never seen before? Google it. An error in your code? Google it.  Exercise 3: Provide at least 2 extra resources you could find about the pandas function drop() on the internet.\nTutor, TA (Through slack, zoom, or in-person) We want to help you with your work; we want to answer your questions; but most importantly, we want to help you succeed in this class. That will require you to put in the necessary time in understanding the readings, coding and debugging. When you ask us a question, we expect that you have read the documentation, searched the textbook, and done your own research. Then we can be most helpful and can provide insights on top of your understanding.\nExamples of bad questions  How does drop() work? We will ask you to read the documentation for drop(). How do you make a table in a markdown file? We will refer you to the textbook. I don\u0026rsquo;t want these columns in my data, how can I drop them? We will ask you if you have found any things on the internet.  Examples of good questions  I am still confused about the syntax of drop(). After reading the documentation, this is my understanding of the function\u0026hellip; . What am I missing? I tried making a table in markdown (show code), it is still not giving me what I want, how can I fix this? I am trying to drop these columns in my dataframe, I think drop() is what I am looking for. Am I in the right direction? If not, what keywords should I be googling?  Exercise 4:\nUsing the code and tools mentioned above, finish question 4 and 5 under 3.2.4 in the textbook.(use the data in mpg for your plot):\n# library import import pandas as pd import altair as alt # data import url = \u0026quot;https:\/\/github.com\/byuidatascience\/data4python4ds\/raw\/master\/data-raw\/mpg\/mpg.csv\u0026quot; mpg = pd.read_csv(url)   Question 4: Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.\n  Question 5: What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?\n  After you have completed this skill builder with your team (or on your own) then compare your work to our script    See the script.   </p><p></p>",url:"https:\/\/byuistats.github.io\/DS250-Cannon\/skill_builders\/introduction\/"},{value:"Project 0: Introduction",label:"<p>Background We will complete six projects during the semester that each take about four days of class. On average, a student will spend 2 hours outside of class per hour in class to complete the assigned readings, submit any Canvas items, and complete the project (for a total of 8 hours per project). The instruction for each project will be structured into sections as written on this page.\nThis first Background section provides context for the project. Make sure you read the background carefully to see the big picture needs and purpose of the project.\n Python and VS Code are tools commonly used in the field of data science. During our first two days of class we will get VS Code prepped for data science programming. Completing Project 0 will set you pu for success the rest of the semester.\nData Every data science project should start with data, and our class projects are no different. Each project will have \u0026lsquo;Download\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Information\u0026rsquo; links like the ones below.\n Download: mpg data\nInformation: Data description\nReadings The Readings section will contain links to reading assignments that are required for each project, as well as optional references. Remember that you are reading this material to build skills. Take the time to comprehend the readings and the skills contained within.\nWe recommend reading through the assigned material once for a general understanding before the first day of each project. You will reread and reference the material multiple times as you complete the project.\n The readings listed below are required for the first two days of class.\n Python for Data Science (P4DS): Introduction P4DS: Data Visualization Section 3.1 \u0026amp; 3.2 Only  Optional References  VS Code user interface Reading Technical Documentation  Questions and Tasks: This section lists the questions and tasks that need to be completed for the project. Your work on the project must be compiled into a rport and submitted in Canvas by the weekend following the last day of material for the project.\n  Finish the readings and be prepared with any questions to get your environment working smoothly (class for on-campus and Slack for online) In VS Code, write a python script to create the example Altair chart from section 3.2.2 of the textbook (part of the assigned readings). Note that you have to type chart to see the Altair chart after you create it. Your final report should also include the markdown table created from the following (assuming you have mpg from question 2).  print(mpg .head(5) .filter([\u0026#34;manufacturer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;model\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;year\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;hwy\u0026#34;]) .to_markdown(index=False)) Deliverables: Deliverables are “the quantifiable goods or services that must be provided upon the completion of a project”. In this class the deliverable for each project is a HTML report created using Quarto. This final section will be the same for each project.\n Use this template to submit your Client Report. The template has three sections (for additional details please see the instructional template):\n A short summary that highlights key that describes the results describing insights from metrics of the project and the tools you used (Think “elevator pitch”).

What is a data scientist?    Brother Hathaway\u0026rsquo;s definition:\n A blend of programmer, statistician, and communicator that burns with curiosity.\n My definiton for DS 250:\n Someone who can extract insights from data and then communicate those insights with clarity.\n Learn more about the BYU-Idaho data science program here.\n   What is data science programming?    Data scientists write code as a means to an end, whereas software developers write code to build things. Data science is inherently different from software development in that data science is an analytic activity, whereas software development has much more in common with traditional engineering.\nData scientists tackle problems such as identifying fraudulent transactions, or predicting which employees are likely to leave a company. Software developers can take the data scientists models and turn them into fully functioning systems with production-quality code. Software developers tackle problems like getting an algorithm to run more efficiently, or building user interfaces.\n   Course Outcomes    Upon completing this course, you will be able to use data-driven programming in Python to handle, format, and visualize data. We will introduce you to data wrangling techniques (panadas), analytical methods (scikit-learn), and the grammar of graphics (Altair). Specifically, as a successful learner, you will be able to:\n Use functions, data structures, and other programming constructs efficiently to process and find meaning in data. Programmatically load data from various types of data sources, including files, databases, and remote services. Use data manipulation libraries to perform straightforward analysis, produce charts, and prepare data for machine learning algorithms. Use machine learning libraries to discover insights, make predictions, and interpret the success of these algorithms. Collaborate and share your work with industry-leading tools.     BYU-Idaho Mission Statement     Brigham Young University-Idaho was founded and is supported and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Its mission is to develop disciples of Jesus Christ who are leaders in their homes, the Church, and their communities.\n  How would you describe a leader? What makes a leader powerful? What does a leader do with insights?  An example of a good leader.\nWhat (or who) is truth?\n   ## Course Format and Grading How hard is this class going to be?    The reality of CSE 250:\n We have done all we can to ensure that this is a 2-credit course for the average student. That means that we expect 4-6 hours outside of class for the average student to achieve an A. You have to put in the time if you want to build skills. The course is necessarily creative in nature. That fact usually makes it feel more challenging. We will be asking you to learn to write creative data science python code. If you have any concerns, please talk with me!     What is the structure of CSE 250?    The class uses 7 projects to teach data science programming in Python using pandas, Altair, scikit-learn, and numpy.\n Projects Syllabus     How do I get the grade I want?

DS programming requires a lot of data wrangling. Using the proper functions, we can create concise and comprehensive codes. You should be exposed to a few functions through the readings this week.\nYou may want to at least scan the readings before beginning this task since this serves as an assessment of your understanding of the assigned readings. A prepared student should be able to finish the exercises within 60 minutes. You should work through it on your own.\nBefore you start Make sure you have installed VS-code, pandas, and Altair on your computer. You can install these packages by typing this line in the terminal:\npip install pandas altair\nOR if you have more than one version of python:\npip3.9 install pandas altair\npip3.9 indicates the version of python you are installing the packages to.\nData import Run the following code to import the data we need for this skill builder:\n# package import import numpy as np import pandas as pd import altair as al # data import dat = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;https:\/\/vincentarelbundock.github.io\/Rdatasets\/csv\/AER\/Guns.csv\u0026#34;) Make sure the variable dat is correctly assigned in your environment and finish the following exercises. You can read the documentation of the data on this page - https:\/\/vincentarelbundock.github.io\/Rdatasets\/doc\/AER\/Guns.html\nExercise 1 One of the first things we can do to a freshly imported data is to check its columns. This will help us understand the basic structure of the dataframe(table).\n Using one line of code, select all the columns in dat, assign it to a variable called col_list.\n  Hint Every dataframe has an attribute \u0022columns\u0022. Accessing this attribute will give you a list of all column names  We often want to know the dimension of a dataframe. How many columns are in the dataset? How many rows are in the dataset?\n Using one line of code, show the number of columns and rows in dat.\n  Hint Every dataframe has an attribute \u0022shape\u0022. Accessing this attribute will give you the dimension of a datafarme  Now run dat.head(). It will print out the first 5 rows of data in dat.\n Just from looking at the output, what column(s) seems to be redundant with the row number?\n  Hint There is one column that serves as nothing but a row counter, that columns is redundant.  Exercise 2 After a brief investigation of the data, we will clean up the data. By cleaning up, we are trying to filter down dat so this only holds data we need. We will first get rid of the extra column we found in the previous excercise.\n Using one line of code, drop the redundant column using the variable col_list (created in excercise 1)\n  Hint Use `drop()`. Understand what \u0026ldquo;axis\u0026rdquo; is as a parameter of drop().\nYour function should looks like this:\ndat.drop([col_list[_]], axis = _)\nfill the \u0026ldquo;_\u0026quot;\u0026rsquo;s with the correct values and assign the output to dat.\n Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to save the changes in dat. Run dat.head() to make sure the column is dropped in dat.\nExercise 3 We have filtered dat vertically by dropping a column. Now we will try to filter dat horizontally, meaning we will get rid of some the rows.\nWe can do that by applying a condition to dat. A condition is an expression that can be evaluated as True\/False. For example, 8 \u0026gt; 5 is an expression that evaluates to be True. This is trivial because 8 will always be greater than 5.\nRun the code below:\n what is the difference between exp1 and exp2?\n exp1 = 8 \u0026gt; 5 exp2 = dat.violent \u0026lt; 300  Hint Try type() on else variable OR calling else variable.  Run ths code below:\n By putting dat.violent \u0026lt; 300, and the violent column from dat into a dataframe, what is the relationship between the two columns?\n exp = pd.DataFrame({\u0026quot;dat.violent \u0026lt; 300\u0026quot; : exp2, \u0026quot;violent value from dat\u0026quot; : dat.violent}) exp  Hint Try computing `dat.violent[n]  Using query(), filter down the dat so that it only contains the data for idaho\n  Hint query() takes in expressions and filters down data.  Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to save the changes in dat. Run dat.shape() to make sure the there are 23 rows and 13 columns.\nExercise 4 Besides filtering, we can manipulate the data by adding new data to it.

Parents would choose names from the pool of existing names rather than invent new ones for their children.\nWith the rise of Christianity, certain trends in naming practices manifested. Christians were encouraged to name their children after saints and martyrs of the church. These early Christian names can be found in many cultures today, in various forms. These were spread by early missionaries throughout the Mediterranean basin and Europe.\nBy the Middle Ages, the Christian influence on naming practices was pervasive. Each culture had its pool of names, which were a combination of native names and early Christian names that had been in the language long enough to be considered native.

In the best case scenario you may only wait a few extra minutes for the plane to be cleaned. However, those few minutes can stretch into hours if a mechanical issue is discovered or a storm develops. Arriving hours late may result in you missing a connecting flight, job interview, or your best friend’s wedding.\nIn 2003 the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) began collecting data on the causes of delayed flights. The categories they use are Air Carrier, National Aviation System, Weather, Late-Arriving Aircraft, and Security. You can visit the BTS website to read definitions of these categories.\nThe JSON file for this project contains information on delays at 7 airports over 10 years.

Questions and Tasks   Which airport has the worst delays? Discuss the metric you chose, and why you chose it to determine the “worst” airport. Your answer should include a summary table that lists (for each airport) the total number of flights, total number of delayed flights, proportion of delayed flights, and average delay time in hours.\n  What is the best month to fly if you want to avoid delays of any length? Discuss the metric you chose and why you chose it to calculate your answer. Include one chart to help support your answer, with the x-axis ordered by month. (To answer this question, you will need to remove any rows that are missing the Month variable.)\n  According to the BTS website, the “Weather” category only accounts for severe weather delays. Mild weather delays are not counted in the “Weather” category, but are actually included in both the “NAS” and “Late-Arriving Aircraft” categories. Your job is to create a new column that calculates the total number of flights delayed by weather (both severe and mild). You will need to replace all the missing values in the Late Aircraft variable with the mean. Show your work by printing the first 5 rows of data in a table. Use these three rules for your calculations:__\n 100% of delayed flights in the Weather category are due to weather  30% of all delayed flights in the Late-Arriving category are due to weather. From April to August, 40% of delayed flights in the NAS category are due to weather. The rest of the months, the proportion rises to 65%.    Using the new weather variable calculated above, create a barplot showing the proportion of all flights that are delayed by weather at each airport. Discuss what you learn from this graph.\n  Fix all of the varied missing data types in the data to be consistent (all missing values should be displayed as “NaN”). In your report include one record example (one row) from your new data, in the raw JSON format.

A relational database consists of tables\/data sets that share columns. These shared columns then establish the relationship between the tables, thus the name relational database. The relations are sometimes not easily found and they require careful investigations.\nTo understand what is in a relational database, we can start with understanding the tables and the columns within.\nHere is a link to the readme file of the baseball database.\n What is the name of the table that records data about pitchers in the regular seasons?\n  What do the HR and HBP columns mean in that table respectively?\n Excercise 2 SELECT and FROM The simplest SQL query is a query with SELECT and FROM. These are the keywords you will see again and again in SQL. Usually, when constructing a more complex query, it is easier to identify what goes into these two clauses first.\n Create a query that shows all columns from the table you found in Exercise 1, save the dataframe in a variable \u0026ldquo;pitch\u0026rdquo;\n You script should look something like:\nresult = pd.read_sql_query( \u0027SELECT _______ FROM _______\u0027, con) results Excercise 2 WHERE The WHERE keyword allows us to filter down the table horizontally (fewer rows).\nIt goes after SELECT and FROM.\n Using a SQL query, select all rows in the same table where HR is lesser than 10 and gs is greater than 25.\n  Find out what the columns mean and explain your query in words\n Excercise 3 ORDER BY ORDER BY sort the table you select by one or more columns and goes after WHERE\n Using the same query in exercise 2, edit it so that the table is ordered by the year of the season(nearest to furthermost) and the player ID(alphabetically).\n Excercise 4 Joins Joins are used when you wish to create a new table through two different tables. Keep in mind that you have to identify the relationship between two tables before you can correctly join them.\nJOIN goes between FROM and WHERE.\n Identify the shared columns (keys) and join the table in exercise 2 with the salaries table, then filter the data so that it shows only pitchers in the year 1986.\n You should get a dataframe with 306 rows.\nExercise 5 Group by Group by is a keyword we use to lower the level of granularity of a table.

Enjoy!\n   star_rating content_rating genre duration box_office_rev major_hit     9.3 R Crime 142 €1924521976 - €1925521976 no   9.2 R Crime 175 €177034987 - €178034987 no   9.1 R Crime 200 €2617541398 - €2618541398 no   9 PG-13 Action 152 €996115723 - €997115723 no   8.9 R Crime 154 €1172054364 - €1173054364 no    Data Link to csv file: ...\n Exercise 0  Grab the high range value for each movie and put it into a new column called high_range_rev.  Make sure the data type of this new column is numeric!!   Remove the box_office_rev column from the dataset.  The .str.split() and .astype() methods might be of use! Also, to get the euro sign just copy it from here, €, and put it in your code.\nThe first 5 rows of the resulting dataframe should look like this\n   star_rating content_rating genre duration major_hit high_range_rev     9.3 R Crime 142 no 2345444803   9.2 R Crime 175 no 2182412593   9.1 R Crime 200 no 1604872807   9 PG-13 Action 152 no 284317976   8.9 R Crime 154 yes 1791932201     Exercise 1 Convert the major_hit column to 1\/0\u0026rsquo;s. yes -\u0026gt; 1 and no -\u0026gt; 0. Again, there are several ways to accomplish this. Using our old friend np.where is probably the easiest though.\nThe first 5 rows of the resulting dataframe should like this\n   star_rating content_rating genre duration major_hit high_range_rev     9.3 R Crime 142 0 1925521976   9.2 R Crime 175 0 178034987   9.1 R Crime 200 0 2618541398   9 PG-13 Action 152 0 997115723   8.9 R Crime 154 0 1173054364     Exercise 2 Convert the content_rating column using label encoding. We\u0026rsquo;re using label encoding in this case because the movie ratings already have a natural ordering to them. We will replace each rating with a number in it\u0026rsquo;s natural ascending order.\nTo be more specific, here is how we will do it.\n G: 0 PG: 1 PG-13: 2 R: 3  A dictionary and the .map() method could be useful for this exercise. There are other ways of tackling this problem though. Be creative!\nThe first 5 rows of the resulting dataframe should look like\n   star_rating content_rating genre duration major_hit high_range_rev     9.3 3 Crime 142 0 1925521976   9.2 3 Crime 175 0 178034987   9.1 3 Crime 200 0 2618541398   9 2 Action 152 0 997115723   8.9 3 Crime 154 0 1173054364     Exercise 3 The last column that we need to take care of is genre. We will use one hot encoding for this. Make sure to ONLY one hot encode the genre column!\nA useful function for one hot encoding is pd.get_dummies(). I recommend checking out the documentation.\nThe resulting dataframe should look like the following example; don\u0026rsquo;t worry if your high_range_rev column turned into scientific notation—Pandas does this sometimes.\n    star_rating content_rating duration major_hit high_range_rev genre_Action genre_Adventure genre_Animation genre_Biography genre_Comedy genre_Crime genre_Drama genre_Family genre_Fantasy genre_Horror genre_Mystery genre_Sci-Fi genre_Thriller genre_Western     0 9.3 3 142 0 1.92552e\u002b09 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   1 9.2 3 175 0 1.78035e\u002b08 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   2 9.1 3 200 0 2.61854e\u002b09 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   3 9 2 152 0 9.97116e\u002b08 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   4 8.9 3 154 0 1.17305e\u002b09 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0     Exercise 4 Recreate this graph as best you can.

Most likely, you have had 1-2 courses of programming before you have taken CSE 250. Unlike traditional computer science courses, CSE 250 uses Python in an interactive mode instead of building programs. The data provider usually has some big questions that need answering; However, there are hundreds of little issues and responses along the way. We use programming to facilitate this investigation.\nThere are similarities with User Experience Designers. In our case, we don\u0026rsquo;t get to ask users about their experience. We use programming to ask data about its background, and each data set has its own history. We want our analysis to mold to that experience. You can think of data science programming like a first date with your data. You can\u0026rsquo;t write one long program nieve of the issues and nuances each living data set provides.\n   How does CSE 250 compare to CSE 350 or Math 335?    The two courses have similarities. You could think of CSE 250 as an introduction to data wrangling and visualization. Both classes use real-world data and are built around data science projects. There are some critical differences between the two courses.\n In this course, we use Python, and CSE 350 uses R. We are introducing the principles of data science programming in CSE 250. The course is only 2-credits. CSE 250 is intended to introduce visualization, wrangling, and modeling.     How does CSE 250 prepare me for CSE 350, Math 335 and CSE 450?    You will be comfortable with interactive programming and have an introduction to the principles of data formats for data science applications. You will be introduced to principles related to machine learning, data wrangling, and data visualization.   What programming languages do we use in this course?    The course is done using Python. We focus on the pandas and Altair packages.   What are the prerequisites for this course?    Using the new courses at BYU-I, the prerequisite is CSE 110. However, if you have experience programming from other classes, you most likely are prepared for this course.   Why Python instead of R?    The computer science and software engineering programs at BYU-I use Python as their foundational courses. The standard student will have some experience with Python before CSE 250. Python is an essential programming language for data scientists, and we already have CSE 350\/Math 335, which is taught in R.   What is pandas?    pandas is the foundational data science package in Python. If you are using tabular data you will be in pandas.   Why are we using Altair instead of Seaborn or Matplotlib?    Matplotlib was the first visualization package to gain a following in Python. Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib. Many data scientists use both in their work—neither leverage the grammar of graphics as developed by Leland Wilkinson. Altair is built on Vega-Lite, which uses the Vega visualization grammar. It is declarative and actively developed. We expect that it will become the predominant visualization package in Python (https:\/\/youtu.be\/FytuB8nFHPQ and https:\/\/youtu.be\/vTingdk_pVM).   </p>",url:"https:\/\/byuistats.github.io\/DS250-Cannon\/faq\/"},{value:"Projects",label:"<p>We will be relying on a few resources for this course.
