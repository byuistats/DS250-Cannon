### Overview

This course provides a better understanding of data programming.  If you have signed up for this class, you are most likely driven by curiosity and interested in how data decisions are made (sometimes called data intuition).  Possibly, you have a more empathetic approach to how the world works and how problems can be solved.  Finally, you have an eye for how society reports and uses data to make impactful decisions.[^1].

Upon completing this course, you will be able to use data-driven programming in Python to handle, format, and visualize data.  We will introduce you to data wrangling techniques, analytical methods, and the grammar of graphics. Specifically, as a successful learner, you will be able to;

1. __Use functions, data structures, and other programming constructs efficiently to process and find meaning in data.__
1. __Programmatically load data from various types of data sources, including files, databases, and remote services.__
1. __Use data manipulation libraries to perform straightforward analysis, produce charts, and prepare data for machine learning algorithms.__
1. __Use machine learning libraries to discover insights, make predictions, and interpret the success of these algorithms.__
1. __Use industry-leading tools to collaborate and share your work.__

#### Principles of DS teaching

The course follows these principles of teaching Data Science[^2]   

* _Organize the course around a set of diverse projects_
* _Integrate computing into every aspect of the course_
* _Teach abstraction, but minimize reliance on mathematical notation_
* _Structure course activities to realistically mimic a data scientist's experience_
* _Demonstrate the importance of critical thinking/skepticism through examples_

#### Competency assumptions

This course focuses on programming with data to find insights.  The prerequisite for this course is an introductory programming course in Python ([CSE 110](https://www.byui.edu/catalog#/courses/rkrSeUvn7?bc=true&bcCurrent=Programming%20Building%20Blocks&bcItemType=Courses))[^3]. We recommend taking [CSE 111](https://www.byui.edu/catalog#/courses/H1EmfUvn7?bc=true&bcCurrent=Programming%20with%20Functions&bcItemType=Courses) before or during the same semester you take this course - especially if programming is complicated for you.  We assume that you do know what the Terminal is and how to execute scripts.

An understanding of [standard deviation](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/displaying-describing-data/sample-standard-deviation/v/statistics-standard-deviation){target="blank"} and [variance](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/displaying-describing-data/sample-standard-deviation/v/statistics-sample-variance){target="blank"} will be valuable.  

### Course materials and structure

This course focuses on building core data science skills. You will learn to program, but you will also learn how to communicate and collaborate with your peers and mentors.

#### Course communication

> How do I talk with my teacher, TA, and other students in this class?

1. We use __Slack__ for most class and one-on-one communication. Don't email or direct message using I-Learn.   
    A. Should I paste code snippets in our class Slack channel to get help? __Yes.__   
    B. Should I ask questions about the projects and the readings in our class Slack channel? __Yes.__   
    C. Should I post random quotes or videos in our class Slack channel? __No.__ _Use the #random channel._   
2. All assignments are submitted in I-Learn.     
    A. Each project submission requires you to submit a short message to the teacher about your work.   
    B. We will respond to your message with edits you can make to earn full credit on your resubmit.   
    C. Class announcements about the grading of projects are posted in I-Learn.   
#### Online reading materials

* [Python for Data Science](https://byuidatascience.github.io/python4ds/): A port of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) using the Python packages pandas and Altair.
* [pandas User Guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/index.html)
* [Altair User Guide](https://altair-viz.github.io/)
* [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)
* [SQL by data.world](https://docs.data.world/documentation/sql/concepts/basic/intro.html)

#### Preparation

In my experience, getting lectured training outside of college is even more expensive than it is in college.  A week's worth of training can cost more than a semester of school here at BYUI. Due to this expense, learning how to digest online material gain understanding before going to the expert with questions is a valuable skill to develop.  **I expect that you have completed the assigned reading material before class begins.**

### Specifications grading {#spec}

Grading is a nasty side effect of mass learning and academia.  We are in a class at a university and will have to manage this side effect.  **However, we don't have to let it control our learning, thinking, or this class.  Learning and thinking should motivate each activity.** 

As we team, teacher and student, we have the challenge to become more!  We have worked hard to identify the specifications needed for a python user of the pandas and Altair packages.  Our goal is to align your grade with the skill specification you have mastered.  In other words, the grade you want will determine how much work you will do.  We will not score individual tasks in the class on a percentage scale.  If your work meets the specified criteria, you will get full credit. 

In a specifications-grading system, all tasks are evaluated on a high-standards pass/fail basis using detailed checklists of task requirements and expectations[^4].  You earn your letter grade by earning passing marks on a set of tasks. This system provides various choices and is closer to how learning and work occur in the real world. It will be easy for us to tell if work is complete, done in good faith, and consistent with the requirements.

#### Grading Scale and Elements {#scale}

The **grading scale** describes the amount of work you must put into the **grading elements** to achieve the your desired grade. The grading scale only lists requirements for A, B, C, and D. You can request half-step adjustments if you fall slightly short or over on some elements.

You will need to provide a detailed description of your completed grading elements in your Review and Request Letter (due at the end of the semester) to support your grade request. For example, if a student was in the B range they might write the following:

*"I got three fives, one four, and two threes for 29 points on the projects. I met the checkpoint requirements with 4 halfway checkpoints and 4 full-mark methods checkpoints. I regularly attended data science society.  I believe my coding challenge will be above a 3.  I request a B+."*

    {{% tab "Projects" %}}

#### Projects (Grand questions)

_Each of the seven projects is worth 5 points and you get one additional submission after the due date. There are 5 two-week projects and two one-week projects to start and end the class._

##### Grading Details

* **1 point:**  Submission
* **3 points:** submission of a good faith attempt with a statement of work quality.
* **4 points:** High-quality work that addresses each of the _Grand Questions_ and a statement of work quality.
* **5 points:** Addressed reviewer issues and completion of resubmission if needed.

    {{% /tab %}}

    {{% tab "Checkpoints methods" %}}

#### Checkpoints (methods and calculations)

_These checkpoints are in Canvas and they open when the project starts.  They have unlimited attempts and remain open until the end of the semester._

##### Examples

* **Fact-Finding Questions (Calculate descriptive summaries):**  Fact-finding questions help you with calculations that build into the _Grand Questions_ of the project.  These questions have clearly defined answers using Python calculations.  You should expect 2-3 problems.

1. Example: Using the top 10 airports in size, what is the average size?
2. Example: What proportion of flights are delayed at the largest airport?

* **How the code works questions (Explaining the tools):**  This part could have direct answer questions or open-ended questions.  

1. Example (direct):  What is the recommended function for arranging your data by a variable? What are the outputs after using `<FUNCTION>`?
2. Example (open): Your client has shown some confusion about NumPy's 'nan' handling in Python. Help them understand by answering the question, 'How is missing data handled in Pandas?'

    {{% tab "Checkpoints mid-project" %}}

#### Checkpoints (Mid-project status)

_The mid-project checkpoint has a few questions.  It opens the first day of the project and closes at 1 am on the 3rd day of class for the project. It has the following questions._

##### Examples

1. Have you checked off more than one grand question from the current project?  (Yes/No)
2. Have you spent at least 2 hours using code to tackle problems related to the case study? (Yes/No).
3. Have you prepared questions you have about the case study to ask in your next meeting? (Yes/No).

    {{% /tab %}}

    {{% tab "DS community" %}}

#### Data science community

To earn credit for the DS Community element you must complete two different tasks from the list below. At the end of the semester, you will be asked to report on which tasks you completed and what you learned from them.

-  Attend [Data Science Society](https://byuidatascience.github.io/society/) at least once.
- Sign up for an email newsletter that will teach you more about data science. [Data Science Weekly](https://www.datascienceweekly.org/) or [Data Elixir](https://dataelixir.com/) are good options.
- Listen to a podcast episode about data science. [Build a Career in Data Science](https://podcast.bestbook.cool/) has some excellent episodes.
- Watch a professional presentation on YouTube about data science. Be prepared to share the link and a summary of the video.
- Reach out to someone who works in a data-related field and ask them for 15 minutes of their time. Use this time to conduct an "[informational interview](https://brightspotcdn.byu.edu/54/b6/2554ebb842fab54640a15ff0afb3/informational-interview.pdf)" and learn more about their responsibilities and career path.
- Research and apply to at least 5 data-related jobs or internships.

#### Finishing the semester

Submit a _request and review_ letter that includes what you have learned from this class, the next data science course you plan on taking, and the final grade that you are requesting based on the work you have submitted.

    {{% /tab %}}

    {{% tab "Challenge" %}}

#### Coding challenge

We will have an in-class coding challenge on the ultimate or penultimate day of class. It would be best if you did not view this challenge like a traditional exam.  It will cover the general techniques that we have been practicing throughout the course.

We expect to have a few practice challenges throughout the semester. We will score the coding challenge on a four-point scale.

- **1 point:** At least you tried.
- **2 points:** You have learned some items from the course, but your work in the coding challenge is deficient.
- **3 points:** Your submission uses proper coding techniques and addresses the objective.
- **4 points:** Exceptional work.  Your code can be used as a solution to share with others.

[^1]: https://medium.com/@nikhilbd/what-makes-a-good-data-scientist-engineer-a8b4d7948a86#.jr80wl98y. I suppose some of you are just taking this class because your degree says you can, and it fits in your schedule. If so, we should chat to make sure this is the right class for you.
[^2]: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1612/1612.07140.pdf. You will see this pattern in CSE 350, CSE 451, and Math 488.  It will progressively get more realistic. 
[^3]: We do expect that this is not your first experience with Python and VS Code.  If you have done other programming courses, you should be able to succeed in this course. If you have any questions, please ask.
[^4]: Making the right checklists can be difficult.  Bad checklists could fall in the following categories -- vague and imprecise; too long; hard to use; impractical; too pedantic. Useful checklists are precise, efficient, easy to use and understand. This is the first time this course has been offered, so we will have to work together to ensure the requirements are reasonable.
